A web app designed for expanding vocabulary by encouraging the use of user-added words in real-world social situations. The aim is to transform passive vocabulary into active vocabulary through intentional incorporation into one's speech or writing. The app has 5 main components that work together to achieve this objective. The “Add Word Component” allows users to add new words in a personalized list, accompanied with a self-written description of the word based on their understanding. The “Phonetic Retrieval Component” automatically retrieves the phonetic version of the word to help with pronunciation and display it next to the word. The “List Management Component” will allow users to check a box (displayed next to the word) once the word has been used in a real-world social situation. When the box is checked, the word will be removed from the list. The “Usage Tracking Component” provides with the list that serves as a reminder of all the words the user has added and still has to use in his own speech/writing. The “Word List Manager Component” will automatically create a new blank list everyday to help with organization of the words and lists from previous days will be archived and accessible through an intuitive calendar view.
